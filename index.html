			<h1>Introduction:</h1>
			<p>My name is Ben Young, I'm 27-years-old, living in Houston, Texas. In 2012, I graduated from Pepperdine University, with a B.S. in Biology and a minor in English. Most recently, I have been learning programming at Thinkful.</p>
			<p>I am a huge animal lover, and one of my passions is helping animals. I've volunteered at animal shelters and fostered several dogs. In 2014, I fostered a pregnant stray and ended up keeping one of the puppies, who I named Penelope. I feel like we have a unique bond because I have been with her since the day she was born.</p>

			<p>Since high school, I have lived in Austin, Malibu, Los Angeles, Marina Del Rey, and Nashville.</p>

			<h1>More About Me:</h1>
			<h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
			<p>One of my favorite hobbies is poker. I love playing poker, watching poker, reading about poker, thinking about poker, etc. While I was still living in California, I would play regularly at the local casinos and was pretty successful in their daily tournaments. Although there are no casinos in the Houston area, I still play occasionally online. Because all of the big, real-money sites have been banned in the U.S., I play on the bitcoin site, "Seals with Clubs" (<a href="https://swcpoker.eu/">swcpoker.eu</a>).</p>
			<p>My other hobbies include playing pool, tennis, cooking, and gardening.</p>
			<h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
			<p>My dream job would be to work as a software developer for a tech startup. Specifically, I would love to work for a company that does something with the bitcoin and/or blockchain technologies, as I find them extremely interesting and am intrigued by the various other potential applications of the blockchain.<p/>
				<h2>What music have you been listening to recently?</h2>
				<p>I am going to the music festival "Riot Fest" in September. In anticipation of the event, I've mostly been listening to the bands I plan to see there, such as Brand New, Underoath, Touch&eacute; Amor&eacute;, Death Cab for Cutie, and The Anniversary. The band I am most excited to see (and happens to be my all-time favorite) is Thursday. Although I've seen them eight times previously, this is one of the first shows they're playing on a reunion tour since their break-up in 2011.</p>
